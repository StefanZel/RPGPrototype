# 3D Story-driven RPG
## About this project
The main game theme will be focused around story with great importance of combat and loot aspect. The best way to describe this game would be to compare it to the Baldurs Gate 3, I plan to implement a similar combat style as BG3 and try to implement a part Path of Exile's crafting system. So, the game in general could be described as a Story Driven Looter RPG.

This is a passion project I worked on for quite some time, it's overly ambitious and time consuming so the progress might be slow. The current code should be treated as a prototype that can be discarded at any time, I'm still testing some features that might never find their way in the final game I envisioned.

I will provide details about current progress on Trello(Currently under construction. I need to better organize my notes...)
